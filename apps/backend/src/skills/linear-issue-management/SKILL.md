## Linear Issue Management

When managing issues in Linear:

- List issues with filters (team, project, assignee, state) to find relevant work.
- Use get issue for full details before summarizing or updating.
- When triaging, report issue state, assignee, and labels; suggest assignee or state changes when appropriate.
- Search issues by query when the user asks for something specific (e.g. bug, feature name).
- Prefer listing by team or project when the user context is clear.
