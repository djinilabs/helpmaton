  content: "## Intercom Customer Conversations\n\nWhen handling customer conversations in Intercom:\n\n- Use **intercom_search_contacts** (tool name may have a suffix if multiple Intercom servers exist) with shortcut params (email, name, externalId) or a query object to find contacts.\n- Use **intercom_get_conversation** or **intercom_search_conversations** (contactId, state, createdAfter, updatedAfter) to get conversation context before replying.\n- Use **intercom_reply_conversation** to send replies as an admin; keep tone polite and structured.\n- Summarize conversation state (open/closed) and key messages before drafting or sending a reply.\n- For search, use shortcut params when possible (email, name, contactId, state); use full query object only when needed.\n\n## Step-by-step instructions\n\n1. For \"find contact X\": call **intercom_search_contacts** with email or name; use **intercom_get_contact** for full details if needed.\n2. For \"conversations for customer Y\": use **intercom_search_conversations** with contactId (or contactIds); get conversation details with **intercom_get_conversation**.\n3. Before replying: read the full thread via **intercom_get_conversation**; summarize status and last message; draft a polite, structured reply.\n4. Call **intercom_reply_conversation** with the conversation ID and reply body only after the user has confirmed or explicitly asked to send.\n5. Do not include sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII) in replies.\n\n## Examples of inputs and outputs\n\n- **Input**: \"What open conversations does john@example.com have?\"  \n  **Output**: List of conversation IDs and state from **intercom_search_conversations** (contactId or email search); optionally one-line summary per conversation.\n\n- **Input**: \"Draft a reply to conversation 12345 saying we've fixed the issue.\"  \n  **Output**: Short summary of the conversation and a draft reply (acknowledge, answer, close); use **intercom_reply_conversation** only if the user asks to send.\n\n## Common edge cases\n\n- **No contact found**: Say \"No contact found for [email/name]\" and suggest checking spelling or trying another identifier.\n- **No conversations**: Report \"No conversations found\" for that contact and suggest state or date filters.\n- **User wants to send**: Only call **intercom_reply_conversation** when the user explicitly confirms; otherwise return the draft only.\n- **Query format**: Use shortcut params (email, name, contactId, state, createdAfter, updatedAfter) for search; avoid invalid fields like contact_id or q.\n- **API/OAuth error**: Report the error and suggest reconnecting or retrying.\n\n## Tool usage for specific purposes\n\n- **intercom_search_contacts**: Use for \"find contact by email/name\"; use email, name, or externalId shortcuts.\n- **intercom_get_contact**: Use for full contact details after search.\n- **intercom_search_conversations**: Use for \"conversations for customer\" or by state/date; use contactId, state, createdAfter, updatedAfter.\n- **intercom_get_conversation**: Use to read full thread before drafting a reply.\n- **intercom_reply_conversation**: Use to send the reply only after user confirmation; keep tone polite and structured.",
