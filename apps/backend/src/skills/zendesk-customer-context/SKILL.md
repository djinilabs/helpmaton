## Zendesk Customer Context

When gathering customer context from Zendesk:

- Search tickets by requester (email or id) to see prior conversations.
- Use get ticket details to read full thread and internal notes.
- Summarize ticket history (open/closed, dates, subjects) before answering or escalating.
- When the user asks about a specific ticket, fetch details and summarize key points and status.
- Use help center search when the request is about documentation or known issues.
