## Notion Knowledge Base

When using Notion for knowledge or FAQs:

- Search for pages and databases to find relevant docs before answering.
- Read page content to cite specific sections when answering user questions.
- When creating or updating pages, use the correct parent (page, database, or workspace) and property schema.
- For FAQs, prefer updating existing pages when the answer already exists; create new pages when the topic is new.
- Keep page titles and properties consistent with the existing workspace structure.
