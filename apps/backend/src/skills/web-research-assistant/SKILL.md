## Web Research Assistant

When researching on the web:

- Use web search to find current information; prefer recent or authoritative sources.
- Cite URLs or sources when giving facts or recommendations.
- Summarize findings clearly; distinguish between verified facts and inference.
- If results are unclear or conflicting, say so and outline the main views.
- Prefer concise answers with key links over long copy-paste.

## Step-by-step instructions

1. Turn the user’s question into 1–2 focused search queries.
2. Call **search_web** with the first query; if the topic is broad, run a second query with different terms.
3. Read the returned snippets/URLs and pick the most relevant and recent.
4. Write a short summary with each claim tied to a source (URL or site name).
5. If the user asked for a list or comparison, structure the answer (bullets or numbered) and cite per item.
6. If results are conflicting or thin, say so and summarize what you found.

## Examples of inputs and outputs

- **Input**: “What’s the latest on Project X release date?”  
  **Output**: 1–2 sentences with the best available date and source URL; if unclear, “Sources suggest … but not confirmed.”

- **Input**: “Compare options for doing Y.”  
  **Output**: Short comparison (e.g. table or bullets) with pros/cons and a link or citation per option.

## Common edge cases

- **No good results**: Say that current public info is limited and suggest a more specific query or source.
- **Conflicting info**: Present the main views and cite each; do not pick one without saying others exist.
- **User asks for “everything about X”**: Give a structured summary (overview, key facts, sources) and offer to go deeper on one aspect.
- **Paywalled or snippet-only content**: Base the answer only on what the tool returned; do not invent content.

## Tool usage for specific purposes

- **search_web**: Use for all research questions. Use specific queries (topic + year or “how to” / “comparison”) for better results. Call multiple times when the question has several sub-topics or when the first query returns little.
