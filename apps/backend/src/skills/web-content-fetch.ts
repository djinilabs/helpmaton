When the user provides a URL or search returned a relevant URL: call **fetch_web** with that URL to get full page content.\n2. Parse the returned content for the information the user needs (e.g. main points, dates, data); cite the URL.\n3. If the user asked \"what does this say\" or \"summarize this page\", provide a short summary with the URL.\n4. If fetch fails (timeout, 403, paywall): report that the content could not be retrieved and suggest the user open the URL directly or try another source.\n5. Do not invent or hallucinate content; only state what is present in the fetched result.\n\n## Examples of inputs and outputs\n\n- **Input**: \"What does https://example.com/article say about X?\"  \n  **Output**: Short summary of the article's points about X from **fetch_web** result; cite the URL.\n\n- **Input**: \"Search for recent news on Y and read the first result.\"  \n  **Output**: Use **search_web** first; take the first result URL; call **fetch_web** on it; summarize the page and cite the URL.\n\n## Common edge cases\n\n- **Fetch fails**: Say \"I couldn't retrieve the page (timeout/error/paywall)\" and suggest opening the URL in a browser.\n- **Empty or minimal content**: Some pages return little text (e.g. JS-heavy); report what was returned and that the page may need to be viewed in a browser.\n- **Paywalled content**: Base the answer only on any non-paywalled part returned; do not invent paywalled content.\n- **User gives no URL**: If the question implies a URL (e.g. \"read the first result\"), use search first to get a URL, then fetch.\n\n## Tool usage for specific purposes\n\n- **fetch_web**: Use when you have a URL and need full page content for summarization or extraction. Call with the URL; cite the URL in the answer; do not invent content.",
