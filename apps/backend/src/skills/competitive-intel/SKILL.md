## Competitive Intelligence

When researching competitors or market context:

- Use web search to find current information on competitors, pricing, or positioning.
- Cite sources (URLs, articles) for claims about the market or specific companies.
- Summarize comparisons clearly (e.g. features, pricing, positioning).
- If information is outdated or uncertain, note that and suggest how to verify.
- Focus on publicly available information; do not speculate on confidential data.
