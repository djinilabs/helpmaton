## HubSpot Marketing Contacts

When using HubSpot for marketing contacts:

- List or search contacts with relevant properties for segmentation questions.
- Use get contact for full details when the user asks about a specific person or email.
- When asked about lists or segments, summarize contact counts and key properties.
- For campaign context, relate contacts to companies or deals when that helps the answer.
- Prefer search when the user provides an email, name, or other identifier.
