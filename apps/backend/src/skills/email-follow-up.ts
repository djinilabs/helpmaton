  content: "## Email Follow-up\n\nWhen sending follow-up emails:\n\n- Use a clear subject line and professional tone.\n- Keep the body concise: purpose, key points, and call to action.\n- Match the level of formality to the relationship (e.g. prospect vs. existing customer).\n- Do not include sensitive data (passwords, tokens) in the body.\n- Confirm recipient address and intent before sending.\n\n## Step-by-step instructions\n\n1. Confirm with the user: recipient address, purpose of the follow-up, and any key points or call to action.\n2. Draft a short subject line (e.g. “Following up: [topic]”) and body (greeting, purpose, 1–3 bullets or short paragraph, CTA, sign-off).\n3. Do not include passwords, API keys, or other secrets in the body.\n4. Call **send_email** with the agreed recipient, subject, and body only after the user has confirmed or clearly requested sending.\n\n## Examples of inputs and outputs\n\n- **Input**: “Send a follow-up to john@example.com about the demo we discussed.”  \n  **Output**: Propose subject and 2–3 sentence body; ask user to confirm before sending; then call send_email once confirmed.\n\n- **Input**: “Draft a follow-up after a meeting with Acme.”  \n  **Output**: Return the draft only (no send) unless the user explicitly asks to send it.\n\n## Common edge cases\n\n- **Missing recipient**: Ask for the email address before drafting or sending.\n- **User says “send” without prior context**: Confirm recipient and purpose before sending.\n- **Sensitive content in user’s request**: Do not put passwords, tokens, or PII in the email; remind the user and offer a redacted version.\n- **Multiple recipients**: If the tool supports a single recipient, send to one and say you can repeat for others, or ask which one to use.\n\n## Tool usage for specific purposes\n\n- **send_email**: Use only for actually sending the follow-up after the user has confirmed recipient and content. Use it with a clear subject and plain-text or HTML body; never include secrets in the body.",
