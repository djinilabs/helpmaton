## Email Support Reply

When replying to support emails:

- Use a polite, empathetic tone and a clear subject (e.g. Re: [original subject]).
- Structure the reply: acknowledge the issue, answer or next steps, closing.
- Do not include sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII) in the email body.
- If the issue requires escalation or more time, say so and set expectations.
- Confirm the recipient address and that the user requested an email reply before sending.
