## Linear Sprint Planning

When planning sprints or capacity in Linear:

- List teams and projects first to scope the view.
- List issues by team/project and state to see backlog and in-progress work.
- Summarize counts by state or assignee to show capacity or load.
- When asked for sprint scope, filter by project/team and report open or unassigned issues.
- Use issue details (estimate, cycle) when available to enrich summaries.
