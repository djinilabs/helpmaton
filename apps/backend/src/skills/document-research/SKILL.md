## Document Research

When researching from the knowledge base:

- Run search with clear, specific queries; use multiple queries if the topic is broad.
- Synthesize findings across snippets into a concise answer or summary.
- Indicate which documents or sections support each claim.
- When the user asks for a list (e.g. features, steps), extract and order from the docs.
- If the answer is uncertain or partial, say so and suggest where to look next.
