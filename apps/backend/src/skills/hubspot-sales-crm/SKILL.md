## HubSpot Sales CRM

When using HubSpot for sales:

- List or search contacts, companies, and deals to answer pipeline and relationship questions.
- Use get contact/company/deal for full details before summarizing.
- When reporting pipeline, group deals by stage or owner and summarize amounts or counts.
- For contact lookup, prefer search by email or name; then use get for full record.
- Keep property names and IDs consistent with HubSpot’s schema in responses.
