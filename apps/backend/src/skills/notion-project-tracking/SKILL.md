## Notion Project Tracking

When tracking projects or tasks in Notion:

- Query databases with filters and sorts to list tasks or items by status, assignee, or date.
- Read database schema (properties) before querying so filters use valid values.
- When creating database pages, include required properties and use the correct types.
- For status updates, use update database page to change status or other properties.
- Summarize results clearly (e.g. count by status, list of open items).
