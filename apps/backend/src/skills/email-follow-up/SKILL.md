## Email Follow-up

When sending follow-up emails:

- Use a clear subject line and professional tone.
- Keep the body concise: purpose, key points, and call to action.
- Match the level of formality to the relationship (e.g. prospect vs. existing customer).
- Do not include sensitive data (passwords, tokens) in the body.
- Confirm recipient address and intent before sending.
