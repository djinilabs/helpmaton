# Helpmaton Privacy Statement

**Last updated:** January 13, 2026

This Privacy Statement explains how Helpmaton (“**we**”, “**us**”, “**our**”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use our workspace-based platform for managing AI agents and related features (the “**Service**”).

## 1. Who we are

Helpmaton is operated by **Gordon & Teixeira Lda.** (Portugal) and its affiliates (including **DjiniLabs**). The entity responsible for your account may depend on your region and the contracting entity shown on your checkout/invoice.

**Privacy contact:** `privacy@helpmaton.com`

## 2. Information we collect

### 2.1 Information you provide

- **Account information**: name (optional), email address, and authentication-related identifiers.
- **Workspace data**: workspace names, team/member information, permissions, and settings.
- **Agent configuration**: prompts, tools enabled, integration configuration, and related settings.
- **Customer Content**: messages, documents, uploaded files, and other content you choose to store or process via the Service.
- **Support communications**: messages you send us (including emails and in-app support requests).

**Password note:** Helpmaton uses **passwordless “magic link” authentication** for the web UI. We do not ask you for a password to log in and do not store plaintext passwords for that login flow.

### 2.2 Information collected automatically

- **Usage data**: feature usage, requests, and performance/diagnostic data.
- **Device and network data**: browser type, device identifiers, IP address, and general location derived from IP.
- **Cookies and similar technologies**: used for session management, security, and analytics (where enabled).
- **Logs and error reports**: to detect, prevent, and address technical issues.

## 3. How we use information

We use information to:

- Provide, maintain, secure, and improve the Service.
- Authenticate users and prevent fraud/abuse.
- Process payments and administer subscriptions and credits.
- Provide customer support and respond to requests.
- Monitor usage, enforce limits, and troubleshoot issues.
- Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms.

## 4. AI providers, integrations, and third parties

### 4.1 AI providers and model routing

Depending on your configuration, we may send parts of your Customer Content (such as prompts, messages, and relevant context) to third-party AI providers to generate outputs.

You may use:

- **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)**: you provide your own AI provider key (for example via OpenRouter). In that case, requests may be billed by the provider directly to you under the provider’s terms.
- **Credits**: you purchase credits through Helpmaton, which may cover eligible AI usage.

### 4.2 Other integrations

The Service can integrate with third-party services (for example: Slack/Discord, email providers, MCP servers, OAuth providers). When you enable an integration, data may be transmitted to and from that service according to your configuration.

We are not responsible for third-party services’ privacy practices. Please review their privacy policies.

## 5. How we share information

We do **not** sell your personal information. We may share information with:

- **Service providers / subprocessors** that help us operate the Service (for example hosting, analytics, error monitoring, email delivery, payments).
- **Third-party integrations** you enable (as described above).
- **Legal and safety purposes**: to comply with law, respond to lawful requests, protect rights and safety, investigate fraud/security incidents, and enforce our Terms.
- **Business transfers**: if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of assets, information may be transferred as part of that transaction.

## 6. Data retention

We retain information for as long as necessary to provide the Service, comply with law, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements.

**Examples of retention behavior in the product:**

- **Conversation file uploads** (e.g., attachments) may be stored with an automatic expiration policy (currently **30 days** for conversation file storage).
- **Agent memory summaries** are subject to plan-based retention windows (for example, “working” memory is retained for a limited number of hours and summary grains for limited periods), while documents are not subject to automatic retention cleanup.

You can request deletion of certain data as described in Section 10.

## 7. Security

We implement technical and organizational measures designed to protect information. However, no system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 8. Important product privacy notes

- **Agent tools and access**: Agents can be configured with tools that access documents, memory, external services, or third-party APIs. Enabling tools may increase the scope of data an agent can access and process.
- **Memory search warning**: Enabling memory search can allow an agent to recall information across conversations. Misconfiguration may increase the risk of unintended disclosure. Only enable features you understand and have assessed for your use case.

## 9. International transfers

We may process and store information in countries other than where you live. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers.

## 10. Your rights and choices

Depending on where you live, you may have rights to:

- Access and obtain a copy of your personal data.
- Correct inaccurate or incomplete data.
- Request deletion of your personal data.
- Object to or restrict processing.
- Data portability.
- Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.

To exercise rights, contact `privacy@helpmaton.com`. We may need to verify your identity and authority.

## 11. Children’s privacy

The Service is not intended for individuals under **18**. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 12. Changes to this Privacy Statement

We may update this Privacy Statement from time to time. We will post the updated version and update the “Last updated” date.
