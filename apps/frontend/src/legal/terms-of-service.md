# Helpmaton Terms of Service

**Last updated:** January 13, 2026

These Terms of Service (“**Terms**”) govern your access to and use of Helpmaton (the “**Service**”). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to these Terms.

If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

## 1. Who we are

Helpmaton is operated by **Gordon & Teixeira Lda.** (Portugal) and its affiliates (including **DjiniLabs**) (“**Helpmaton**”, “**we**”, “**us**”, “**our**”). The contracting entity for your use of the Service may be identified on your checkout, invoice, or order confirmation.

**Contact:** `legal@helpmaton.com`

## 2. Eligibility

You must be at least **18 years old** to use the Service. If you use the Service on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization, and “you” includes that organization.

## 3. Accounts and security

- You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and credentials and for all activity under your account.
- You must provide accurate information and keep it up to date.
- You must promptly notify us of any unauthorized use or security incident relating to your account.

## 4. The Service

Helpmaton is a workspace-based platform that helps you create, configure, and deploy AI assistants (“agents”), manage documents/knowledge bases, and integrate via webhooks/APIs and third-party connections.

We may change, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Service at any time. We may also impose limits on features, storage, or usage.

## 5. Acceptable use

You agree not to (and not to allow others to):

- Violate applicable laws or regulations.
- Infringe or misappropriate others’ rights.
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service, accounts, systems, or networks.
- Interfere with or disrupt the Service (including by probing, scanning, or testing vulnerabilities).
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract source code from the Service, except where such restriction is prohibited by law.
- Use the Service to develop, provide, or support products or services that compete with the Service.
- Use the Service for high-risk activities where failures could lead to death, personal injury, or severe harm (e.g., medical, emergency response, critical infrastructure), unless you have obtained our written permission.
- Submit malware or attempt to bypass our security, rate limits, or access controls.

We may remove content, suspend accounts, or restrict features if we reasonably believe you violated these Terms or pose risk to the Service, users, or third parties.

## 6. Your content and responsibilities

“**Customer Content**” means content you (or your users) upload, submit, or transmit to the Service, including prompts, messages, documents, files, configuration data, and outputs you choose to store.

- **You control Customer Content**. You represent you have all rights necessary to provide Customer Content and to grant the rights described in these Terms.
- **You are responsible** for Customer Content, the agents you configure, and how you use outputs.
- **AI output is not guaranteed**. Outputs may be inaccurate, incomplete, offensive, or unsafe. You are responsible for evaluating outputs before using or relying on them.

### License to operate the Service

You grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive license to host, store, reproduce, process, transmit, and display Customer Content **only as needed** to provide, secure, and improve the Service, comply with law, and enforce these Terms.

## 7. Third-party services and integrations

The Service may integrate with third-party services (for example: AI model providers, messaging platforms, analytics, OAuth providers, and other APIs). Your use of third-party services is governed by their terms and privacy policies.

We are not responsible for third-party services, including their availability, security, or charges.

## 8. Billing, plans, credits, and provider charges

### Platform subscription vs AI provider charges

Your Helpmaton subscription fees cover platform functionality (such as workspaces, agent configuration, dashboards, document search, and Helpmaton API access). AI model usage may involve **separate costs**.

### Two ways to pay for AI model usage

1. **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)**: You may add your own provider key (for example via OpenRouter). In that case, **you pay the provider directly** under the provider’s terms, and charges are between you and the provider.
2. **Credits**: You may purchase credits through Helpmaton. Credits are consumed for eligible AI usage as described in the product UI and documentation.

### Third-party charges are your responsibility

To the maximum extent permitted by law, you are solely responsible for any charges, fees, bills, disputes, and costs incurred from third parties (including AI providers, cloud services, APIs, messaging platforms, and marketplaces), even if accessed through the Service. We do not provide billing support for third-party invoices.

## 9. Intellectual property

We and our licensors own the Service and all related intellectual property. Except for the limited rights granted in these Terms, no rights are granted to you.

If you provide feedback or suggestions, you grant us the right to use them without restriction or compensation.

## 10. Open-source and repository license (separate from these Terms)

The Service is a hosted offering. Parts of the Helpmaton source code may be made available under a separate license (currently **Business Source License 1.1** with a future change to **Apache 2.0** as described in the repository’s `LICENSE.md`). That repository license governs **source code use**, not your use of the hosted Service.

## 11. Disclaimers

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.

WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR SECURE, OR THAT OUTPUTS WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE.

## 12. Limitation of liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW:

- WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, GOODWILL, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SERVICE OR THESE TERMS.
- OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SERVICE OR THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID TO US FOR THE SERVICE IN THE **THREE (3) MONTHS** BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY (OR, IF GREATER, **€100**).

Nothing in these Terms limits liability for fraud, willful misconduct, or any liability that cannot be limited under applicable law.

## 13. Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Helpmaton and our affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or relating to:

- your access to or use of the Service;
- Customer Content;
- your agents’ actions or outputs (including how you deploy or integrate them);
- your violation of these Terms; or
- your violation of any third-party rights.

## 14. Suspension and termination

We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service immediately (with or without notice) if we reasonably believe:

- you violated these Terms;
- your use creates risk or legal exposure for us, other users, or third parties; or
- we are required to do so by law.

On termination, your right to use the Service ceases. Provisions that by their nature should survive will survive (including Sections 6, 7, 11–16).

## 15. Governing law and venue

These Terms are governed by the laws of **Portugal**, without regard to conflict of laws principles. You and we agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of **Funchal, Madeira, Portugal**.

If you are a consumer and mandatory consumer protection laws in your jurisdiction grant you the right to bring claims in a different forum or under different law, those rights are not waived.

## 16. Changes to these Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. If changes are material, we will provide notice (for example by posting the updated Terms and updating the “Last updated” date, and/or by in-app notice). Your continued use after an effective date means you accept the updated Terms.

## 17. Severability

If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.
