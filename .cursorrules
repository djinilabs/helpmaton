# Cursor Agent Rules for Helpmaton Project

## Code Quality Checks

1. Always run `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm lint` after making new code or code changes. These checks must pass before considering the task complete.

## Database Best Practices

2. Do not use database table scans. Always prefer to use queries and indexes if required. When working with database operations:
   - Use indexed queries instead of full table scans
   - Create indexes when necessary to optimize query performance
   - Avoid operations that require scanning entire tables

## AWS access

3. You can use the AWS CLI to fetch any setting in AWS, or browse the logs

## PR deployments

4. Each PR in Github creates a Cloudformation stack with a replica of the production environment.

## Github access
