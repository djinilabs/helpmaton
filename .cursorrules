# Cursor Agent Rules for Helpmaton Project

## Code Quality Checks

1. Always run `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm lint` after making new code or code changes. These checks must pass before considering the task complete.

## Database Best Practices

2. Do not use database table scans. Always prefer to use queries and indexes if required. When working with database operations:
   - Use indexed queries instead of full table scans
   - Create indexes when necessary to optimize query performance
   - Avoid operations that require scanning entire tables

## AWS access

3. You can use the AWS CLI to fetch any setting in AWS, or browse the logs.

## PR deployments

4. Each PR in Github creates a Cloudformation stack with a replica of the production environment. Use the AWS CLI to query it.

## Github access

5. You can use the gh CLI to get access to any result or setting in Github

## Infrastructure as code

6. Never make any changes to the AWS infrastructure directly. Instead, you can make infrastructure changes by editing app.arc, any of the Architect plugins we use or the code in the lambda functions.
