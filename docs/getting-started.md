Helpmaton is a workspace-based platform for managing AI agents and their interactions. You can create workspaces, add agents, and configure them to handle various tasks.

## Quick Start

1. **Create a Workspace**

   - Workspaces help you organize your agents and documents

2. **Add an Agent**

   - Navigate to your workspace
   - Click "CREATE AGENT"
   - Provide a name and system prompt for your agent
   - The system prompt defines how your agent behaves

3. **Upload Documents**

   - Use the document upload area to add markdown or text files
   - Organize documents into folders for better management
   - Documents can be used to inform agent behavior

4. **Test Your Agent**
   - Use the agent's webhook endpoint to send messages
   - Monitor responses and adjust system prompts as needed
